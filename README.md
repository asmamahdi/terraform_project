## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements a comprehensive AWS infrastructure using Terraform with the following components:

- **VPC**: Custom Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer (ALB) for high availability
- **Compute**: Auto Scaling Groups with EC2 instances in private subnets
- **Database**: RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- **Storage**: S3 buckets for assets and logs with lifecycle policies
- **Networking**: NAT Gateways for secure outbound internet access
- **Security**: Security groups, IAM roles, and least-privilege access

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏢 **Multi-Environment**: Dev, Staging, Production
- 🔧 **Modular Design**: Reusable Terraform modules
- 🔒 **Security-First**: Private subnets, security groups, IAM roles
- 📊 **Auto Scaling**: EC2 Auto Scaling Groups with ALB
- 🗄️ **Managed Database**: RDS MySQL with high availability
- 📈 **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics
- 💾 **State Management**: S3 backend with DynamoDB locking ✅ **WORKING**
- 🚀 **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with NAT Gateways

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions

### 1. Setup S3 Backend (One-time setup)
```bash
cd environments/backend
terraform init
terraform apply -var="bucket_name=your-unique-bucket-name"
```

**Note:** The S3 backend is already configured and working for this project! ✅

### 2. Deploy Environment
```bash
cd environments/dev
terraform init  # Will automatically use S3 backend
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Current Status:** ✅ Dev environment is deployed and using S3 backend!

### 3. Access Application
```bash
# Get ALB DNS name
terraform output alb_dns_name

# Access: http://dev-alb-77545298.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

**🌐 Live Application:** [http://dev-alb-77545298.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com](http://dev-alb-77545298.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com) ✅

## 🔧 Available Commands

### Using Makefile (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Deploy development environment
make deploy-dev

# Plan staging environment
make plan-staging

# Destroy production environment
make destroy-prod

# Validate all configurations
make validate
