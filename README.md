- **Database**: RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- **Storage**: S3 buckets for assets and logs with lifecycle policies
- **Networking**: NAT Gateways for secure outbound internet access
- **Security**: Security groups, IAM roles, and least-privilege access

##  Key Features

-  **Multi-Environment**: Dev, Staging, Production
-  **Modular Design**: Reusable Terraform modules
-  **Security-First**: Private subnets, security groups, IAM roles
-  **Auto Scaling**: EC2 Auto Scaling Groups with ALB
-  **Managed Database**: RDS MySQL with high availability
-  **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Performance monitoring and alerting
- **Health Checks**: ALB and RDS health monitoring
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on CloudWatch metrics
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Automated data lifecycle management
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource tagging and lifecycle policies

## What Makes This Project Stand Out
Real-world architecture patterns applied in AWS
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and maintain with reusable components
- **Security-First**: Industry best practices for cloud security
- **Multi-Environment**: Proper environment separation with different configurations
- **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions
- **Automation**: Scripts for common deployment tasks
- **Best Practices**: Follows Terraform and AWS best practices
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle production workloads

## Next Steps
## Next Steps

Potential enhancements include:  
- **Configuration Management**: Integrating Ansible or Puppet for OS and application-level management  
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Adding Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch custom metrics for deeper visibility  
- **Security Enhancements**: Expanding with AWS WAF, GuardDuty, or Security Hub for improved protection  
- **Disaster Recovery**: Implementing cross-region backups and failover strategies  
- **Cost Optimization**: Using resource tagging, lifecycle policies, and Trusted Advisor recommendations
